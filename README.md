# Credit Risk Modeling (Classification Problem)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Credit Risk Modeling**, a classification problem that evaluates the likelihood of loan default. By analyzing financial and demographic data, the project predicts default probabilities, assigns credit scores, and calculates metrics to evaluate model performance. 

An interactive **Streamlit UI** has been developed to make predictions user-friendly and provide a seamless user experience.

## Key Features
- **Weight of Evidence (WOE)** and **IV Score** for categorical feature analysis.
- Tackled **class imbalance** using:
  - **Random Under-Sampling**
  - **SMOTETomek**
- Hyperparameter tuning with **Optuna**.
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Rank Order**: 85.88% found at Decile 8
  - **AUC**: 0.98
  - **Gini Coefficient**: 0.96
- Built an interactive **Streamlit UI** for predictions and insights.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Analyzed data for missing values and outliers.
- Engineered features such as WOE and IV Score.

### 2. Handling Class Imbalance
- Implemented **Random Under-Sampling** and **SMOTETomek** techniques to balance the dataset.

### 3. Model Building
- Built and compared classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost).
- Tuned hyperparameters using **Optuna** for improved accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Rank Order**: Identified distribution of default probabilities.
- **AUC**: Achieved 0.98, indicating excellent performance.
- **Gini Coefficient**: Scored 0.96, showcasing model reliability.

### 5. Interactive UI
- Created a **Streamlit app** to:
  - Accept user input for predictions.
  - Display default probability, credit score, and rating.
